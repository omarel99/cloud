<p>WordPress is a content management system (CMS) that allows you to host and build websites. WordPress contains plugin architecture and a template system, so you can customize any website to fit your business, blog, portfolio, or online store.</p>



<p>But how?</p>



<p>This ultimate guide will cover a basic step-by-step process of&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/build-a-wordpress-website?utm_source=marketing_blog" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">creating your own WordPress website</a>&nbsp;as well as a list of tips and tricks to remember while working with WordPress.</p>

<p>But first, let’s answer the question most people have when they begin thinking about their new WordPress website: What is the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com?</p>



<h3>WordPress.org vs. WordPress.com</h3>



<p><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">The difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com</a>&nbsp;has to do with&nbsp;<em>who</em>&nbsp;is actually&nbsp;<a href="https://ithemes.com/tutorials/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">hosting</a>&nbsp;your website.</p>



<p><em>You</em>&nbsp;host your own website or blog on&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a>, through a third-party hosting provider. You also have to download your WordPress software, buy a domain name on a third-party site, and manage your server. It’s a much more hands-on experience than with WordPress.com.</p>



<p>WordPress.com offers to host your website&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;you. You also don’t need to download any software or manage a server. If you choose WordPress.com, your website’s URL will look like this: www.mywebsite.wordpress.com. However, you have the option to also upgrade your WordPress.com account and buy a custom domain from a third-party provider (meaning your URL will look like this: www.mywebsite.com).</p>



<h4>How to Choose Between WordPress.org or WordPress.com</h4>



<p>You may be wondering whether WordPress.org or WordPress.com would be a better fit. Let’s review a few more of the pros and cons that come with both options, so you can make an informed decision.</p>



<p><strong>WordPress.org</strong>&nbsp;is ideal if you want full power over customizing and controlling your website. However, there is a lot more responsibility that comes with managing a WordPress.org website. You have to purchase and set up your own domain name, upload and install plugins and a theme, edit your website’s code, and manage your website’s security. WordPress.org is free to use, but you have to pay for everything else that goes into having a website.</p>



<p><strong>WordPress.com</strong>&nbsp;is preferable if you’re looking for an all-in-one option that has most of the hard work done for you. You’ll never need to manage your server, pay for your hosting, or buy a domain. There are also a number of customization options that come with a WordPress.com plan to help you make your website look the way you want it to.</p>



<p>WordPress.com has a free and paid version. If you stick with the free version, you can’t upload any custom themes or plugins, and you will have a WordPress subdomain. However, there is always the option to pay for&nbsp;<a href="https://wordpress.com/pricing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">premium upgrades</a>&nbsp;and other plans that provide you with even more features and control, as well as the option to buy a custom domain through a third-party site.</p>
