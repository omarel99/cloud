You also have to download your WordPress software, buy a domain name on a third-party site, and manage your server. It\u2019s a much more hands-on experience than with WordPress.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com offers to host your website&nbsp;<em>for<\/em>&nbsp;you. You also don\u2019t need to download any software or manage a server. If you choose WordPress.com, your website\u2019s URL will look like this: www.mywebsite.wordpress.com. However, you have the option to also upgrade your WordPress.com account and buy a custom domain from a third-party provider (meaning your URL will look like this: www.mywebsite.com).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How to Choose Between WordPress.org or WordPress.com<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be wondering whether WordPress.org or WordPress.com would be a better fit. Let\u2019s review a few more of the pros and cons that come with both options, so you can make an informed decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordPress.org<\/strong>&nbsp;is ideal if you want full power over customizing and controlling your website. However, there is a lot more responsibility that comes with managing a WordPress.org website. You have to purchase and set up your own domain name, upload and install plugins and a theme, edit your website\u2019s code, and manage your website\u2019s security. WordPress.org is free to use, but you have to pay for everything else that goes into having a website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordPress.com<\/strong>&nbsp;is preferable if you\u2019re looking for an all-in-one option that has most of the hard work done for you. You\u2019ll never need to manage your server, pay for your hosting, or buy a domain. There are also a number of customization options that come with a WordPress.com plan to help you make your website look the way you want it to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com has a free and paid version. If you stick with the free version, you can\u2019t upload any custom themes or plugins, and you will have a WordPress subdomain. However, there is always the option to pay for&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.com\/pricing\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">premium upgrades<\/a>&nbsp;and other plans that provide you with even more features and control, as well as the option to buy a custom domain through a third-party site.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress for Beginners: How to Use WordPress<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of ways for you to create your dream website with WordPress. Users generally find the software&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.capterra.com\/p\/131687\/WordPress\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">easy to use<\/a>, but getting started can be understandably intimidating if you\u2019re completely new to the process.
